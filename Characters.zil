"Game - Characters"

"This file will contain the object definitions necessary to represent
characters, their property and clothing."

"There must be at least one character in order to represent the player's role
in the game. The ZILF Library provides a standard player character which may be
used by any game. A game may have more characters and may even have alternate
player characters. Each character can carry property and wear clothing."
