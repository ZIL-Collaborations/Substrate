"Game - Scenes"

"This file will contain the action routines, interrupt routines and global flag
variables necessary to represent scenes."

"There must be at least one scene in order to represent what the player must do
to finish the game. A game may have more scenes running consecutively or
concurrently with the first. It may also be useful to regard exploration of the
setting as a notional concurrent scene."
