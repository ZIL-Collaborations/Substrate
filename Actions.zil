"Game - Actions"

"This file will contain the verb routines and associated syntax definitions
necessary to represent actions."

"It is not necessary to define any actions but there may, in principle, be as
many as are required to support the game."

"Note: as at ZILF 0.9, there is no mechanism to replace syntax definitions in
the ZILF library other than by editing a copy of verbs.zil."
